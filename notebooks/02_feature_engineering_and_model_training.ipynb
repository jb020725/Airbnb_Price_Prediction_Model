    "\n",
    "- **Target variable (`price`) range**:  \n",
    "  The prices in the dataset range from **$50 to $1200**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distribution**:  \n",
    "  The distribution of prices is **relatively uniform**, with no heavy skew.  \n",
    "  This means the model isnâ€™t just learning around a tight cluster but is expected to generalize across a wide and balanced range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relative Error Insight**:  \n",
    "  An RMSE of ~324 means:\n",
    "  - An average error of Â±$324 in price prediction.\n",
    "  - This is approximately **25â€“30%** of the full price range.\n",
    "  - Given the natural noise in real-world Airbnb prices (location, season, amenities, host behavior), this level of error is reasonable for a general-purpose model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No outlier clipping**:  \n",
    "  We allowed the model to learn from natural variance in high/low-priced neighbourhoods, rather than artificially removing outliers â€” which preserves true behavior and makes the RMSE slightly higher but more honest.\n",

    "The RMSE of **324.32** is acceptable for the given price range and data conditions, and the model is well-suited for deployment in a real-world scenario.\n"
